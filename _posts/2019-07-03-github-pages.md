**Hey reader!**

Last year I decided to give up on my custom domain names `joe-pagan.com` and `jpag.io` in favour of Github Pages.

While my old domains held some name based value to me (including one being one of the first I had ever owned), I simply thought there wasn't enough need for them.

I appreciate that this could be different for other developers, but, for me, I found that Github pages was absolutely perfect for my needs.

## 🥳 It's freeeeeee

Github pages have been around for a while, I've used [them](https://joepagan.github.io/GetSchwifty.js/) [before](https://joepagan.github.io/dogey.js/), but, never for the top-level user profile which can actually be suitable enough for a small portfolio website!

## ✍️ It's got this blogging feature

Only recently have I though to try the blogging feature that comes with it. Using Jekyll to do this magic, really nice that it's just in markdown files which is nice! 👍

## 🐙 Github made a really nice generator

The Github team recently put [this Personal website generator](https://github.dev/), which is really simple to setup, looks modern and professional, it pulls in things from my Github profile automatically, awesome!

## 🤔 Conclusion

I'm pretty stoked to find something this low maintenance setup from Github (thanks guys & girls), hopefully it will serve as a nice incentive to get more content out there.
