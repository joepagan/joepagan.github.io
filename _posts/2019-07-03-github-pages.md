**Hey reader!**, last year I decided to give up on my custom domain names `joe-pagan.com` and `jpag.io`

While my old domains held some value to me (name based), including one being one of the first I had ever owned. I simply thought there wasn't enough need for them. I appreciate that this could be different for other developers, but, for me, I found that Github pages was absolutely perfect for my needs.

## 🤑 It's freeeeeee 🎉

Github pages have been around for a while, it's seems nice to have your code in the same place as where you are hosting it.

## ✍️ It's got this blogging feature

Not bad eh? Using Jekyll to do this magic, really nice that it's just in markdown files which is nice! 👍

## 🐙 Github made a nice generator

The Github team recently put [this generator together](https://github.dev/) which is really simple to setup, looks modern and professional, it pulls in things from my github profile automatically, awesome!
